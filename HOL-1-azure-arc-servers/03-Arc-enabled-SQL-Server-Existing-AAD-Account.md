# Exercise 3: Onboard SQL Server to Arc
### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes
## Overview 

In the last exercise, you have seen how to enable security measures and monitoring for Arc-enabled servers. In this exercise, you will onboard SQL Server to Azure Arc using Azure Portal and PowerShell commands.

## Objectives

In this exercise, you will be performing the following tasks:

- Task 01: Login To Azure Portal
- Task 02: Register Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server.
- Task 03: Run on-demand SQL Assessment.

## Task 1: Login To Azure Portal

1. Navigate back to Azure Portal which you have already opened in the previous exercises.
      
1. Click on the search blade at the top and search for ``SQL Server - Azure Arc`` **(1)**, select **SQL Server - Azure Arc (2)**.
 
   ![](.././media/hyd19.png "sqlsearch")
   
1. Click on the **Add** button to create the **SQL Server- Azure Arc**. 
 
   ![](.././media/az-ex3-1.png "sqlsearch")
   
1. In the Adding existing SQL Servers instances page, Click on **Connect Servers**.

   ![](.././media/ss3.png "sqlsearch")
   
1. You will now see the prerequisite page. You can explore the page and then click on the **Next: Server details** option.
    
   > **Note**: We have already completed the prerequisite part for you. 
    
   ![](.././media/presql.png "sqlsearch")
   
1. On the **Server Details** blade, enter the below details.
 
   - Subscription: Leave default **(1)**

   - Resource group: Select **azure-arc (2)** from dropdown list.

   - Region: Select the same region as the Resource group. **(3)**

   - Operating Systems: Select **Windows (4)**.

   - Server Name: Type **sqlvm (5)**

   - License Type: Select **I have a production environment on this server with Enterprise or Standard edition covered by Software Assurance or SQL subscription ("Paid") (6)**.

     Now, click on the **Next: Tags (7)** button.
   
      ![](.././media/hybrid41.png "sqlsearch")
   
1. Leave the default for tags blade and click on **Next: Run Script** button.
 
1. On the **Script** blade, explore the given script. We will be using this PowerShell script to **Register Azure Arc enabled SQL Server** later.
 
   > **Note**: Please **skip the script download** from here by clicking on ``X`` at the top right as we have **already downloaded** this script inside the Lab VM for you.
    
   ![](.././media/runsqlv2.png "sqlsearch")
     
## Task 2: Register Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server.

1. Minimize the Azure Portal Browser window. 

1. From the desktop of your **LabVM/ARCHost VM**, double click on **Windows PowerShell** icon to open it.
 
   ![](.././media/powershell.png "sqlsearch")
  
1. Then, run the below command to change the directory to where the script gets downloaded.
 
   ``` 
   cd C:\LabFiles
   ```

1. After changing the directory to **Lab files**, run the command given below:

   ```
   .\Execute-RegisterSqlServerArc.ps1 
   ```
   > **Note** : If the above command fails, Navigate to the sqlvm within the Hyper-V manager and ensure it is in runnning state, If it is in Off state right click on the Vm and then select start. Once the sqlvm has started wait for some time and re-run the command again if you encounter any warnings or Errors that can be ignored.
    
   > **Note** : This will initiate the execution of **RegisterSqlServerArc.ps1** script inside **sqlvm** that is deployed on Hyper-V.

1. After running the command, you will see that the script started running.

   ![](.././media/run.png "sqlsearch")
  
1. After some time, you will see that the script execution is completed. Make sure that you see the output as shown the image below.

   ![](.././media/completed.png "sqlsearch") 
  
1. Bring back the browser window where you had opened Azure Portal and search for **SQL Server -Azure Arc**. If you are already on that page, you will need to click on the Refresh button. On that page, you will see one resource **SQLVM** that we just created using the PowerShell script in the previous step.

   ![](.././media/hybrid36.png "sqlsearch")

   > **Note** : Please wait for 2-3 minutes until the Mode turns from **Registered** to **Connected** state.
  
1. Select the **SQLVM** resource and now you can see the dashboard of **SQLVM** SQL Server -Azure Arc from Azure Portal.
